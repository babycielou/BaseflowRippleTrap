# BaseflowRippleTrap Overview

## Purpose

The BaseflowRippleTrap is designed to promptly detect significant fluctuations in Ethereumâ€™s block.basefee. The trap triggers when the base fee changes by 1% or more between two consecutive blocks, enabling rapid identification of sudden shifts in network conditions.

## Operation

The collect() function retrieves the current block.basefee on each block.

The shouldRespond() function compares the basefee values of the two most recent blocks, calculates the percentage difference, and checks if it exceeds the 1% threshold.

Upon detecting a meaningful change, the trap signals for further action.

## Parameters and Features

A 1% trigger threshold ensures frequent and timely trap activation.

The trap gracefully handles insufficient data or invalid inputs by avoiding false positives.

The data format supports easy extensibility for future enhancements.

## Response Handler

The BaseflowRippleRelay contract listens for trap signals and emits a RippleDetected event containing a descriptive message. This facilitates seamless integration with monitoring and automation systems.
